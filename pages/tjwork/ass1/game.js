/*
This is essentially a super basic version of duck hunt. Aside from
obvious things like colors and sounds I added a function that places a
"duck" on the grid after removing the old one upon a successful hit
as well as on startup. I also changed the touch function to check to
see if the hit was successful and take the appropriate action such as
playing sounds and calling for a new duck. Upon 10 successful hits,
victory music plays and a encouraging message appears.
