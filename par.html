					<h2>What is modern game development?</h2>
					<p>Many people not actively invovled in the game industry, whether as players or developers, may be unaware of the complexities and various components or modern, high quality "AAA" development. Even players may not be aware of the various elements involved in producing high qaulity games that push the limits of modern technological capabilites.</p>

					<h2>What do games have to do with art?</h2>
					<p>What if I told you that the vast majority of people working on a game are not programmers or engineers but artists and writers and other creative individuals? I found it hard to beleive myself at first, but the only way "stuff" gets into a game is thorugh the labor of an artist. Everything, from characters to enviornemts to users interfaces are carefully created by artists. Moreover, conisdering how much "stuff" has to go into a modern game, the vast majority of developers work in artistic disciplines. Artists are involved in every step of the development process, from the concpet art pictured above, to character models and textures, to promotional materials and eventually the art on the front of the box.</p>

					<h2>Why is technology crucial to game development?</h2>
					<p>Games are absolutely rooted in technological implementation. While CGI movies have the luxury of being able to take days or weeks to render individual frames, game engines must be able to render frames in real time and react to input at a minimum of 30 to 60 times per second. As a result, games easily reperesent one of the most demanding commercial applications of computer hardware and software. Games and the engines rendering them are incredibly advanced peices of code and have been directly responsible for driving significant advancements in computing technology. </p>

					<h2>Why is sound so important to imersion?</h2>
					<p>Much like in the film industry, sound design is one of the most crucial yet under apreciated components of creating a cohesive and imersive experience. The most successful sound design is the one that you don't even notice, and nowhere is this more apparent than in modern games. </p>

					<h2>What brings a character to life?</h2>
					<p>Many people would never guess that real actors are often involved in acting out scenes in games, but motion caputre and voice acting are core elements in crafting a modern, narrative driven game experience. Pictured above is what's known as perfromance capture, where both motion capture and voice recording is perfomed at the same time, much like filming a movie or capturing a live acting performance.</p>

					<h1>Animation</h1>

			<section class="module content">
				<div class="container">
					<h2>How can a game look just as good in motion?</h2>
					<p>Animation is probably one of the most difficult aspects to get just right, yet nailing it is crucial to immersion. If a character moves just a little bit unaturally, the illusion is broken and your audience is immediately drawn out of the moment. This is especially important as games become more realisic looking and character models try to mimic real life perfomances. If a photo realistic model starts moving ever so slightly unnaturally, your risk more than breaking immersion; you can actually end up scaring your audience with "dead" charcters moving about the enviornment. On the other hand, qaulity animation can ground a game in the space crafted by a developer and make the action on screen feel infinitely more natural, independent of art style.</p>

					<h2>How can a model look great with only so much detail?</h2>
					<p>Traditional 3D models were painstakingly created out of millions of triangles and other polygons in order to aproximate natural curvature and geometry. While most engines still rely on creating images out of models made from polygons, the process for creating more organic character models has drastically improved in the past few years. Now artists are able to use 3D sculptiing techinques, much like how one might work with clay, to sculpt character models with infinite detail before converting them into tradditional models made of polygons.</p>

					<h2>How can a game run at its best?</h2>
					<p>The only way to make sure a game squeezes every ounce of performance out of hardware is to optimize every routine until it's as efficient as possible. This is especially relevant for console games where the hardware is known and games can be optimized for exact hardware. And naturally, being a piece of software at its core, games needed plenty of bug testing to ensure an enjoyable experience. Nobody likes falling through the ground to their death or the game crashing in the middle of a boss battle. Many games are also focus tested to get feedback from players on what works and what doesn't.</p>

					<h1>Lighting</h1>
				</div>

			<section class="module content">
				<div class="container">
					<h2>How can realistic lighting be rendered in real time?</h2>
					<p>Lighting is crucial to making a 3D scene look realistic, yet it can be incredibly expenisve from a computational persepctive. Natural lighting is especially tricky to get right, since there is often one primary light source alongside multiple secondary reflecting sources. Ray tracing, the simplest way to get realistic shadows, often requires hundreds of ray traces to accurately create shadows, but is too demanding to use on multiple objects in real time. As a result, multiple methods to achieve similar visuals while using far less computational power have been developed recently. </p>

					<h1>Shaders</h1>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section class="module content">
				<div class="container">
					<h2>What's a shader and why is it crucial to realistic visuals?</h2>
					<p>Shaders, put simply, define how an object reflects light. Just like in the real world, these properties are primarily determined by the material the object is made of. Some shaders, like plastic and metal have relatively simple shader properties, while other shaders such as skin are incredibly complex with tons of variables affecting how light is absorbed and reflected by them. A very recent technique for getting high detail across objects from any draw distacne invovles putting all the detial into the shaders as opposed to traditional techniques relying on detail residing in high polygon models or super high resolution textures. These new tehcniques allow for incredible detail at any distance without relying on swapping models or texture maps as the camera moves in and out, freeing up resources for other tasks.</p>

					<h1>Post Processing</h1>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section class="module content">
				<div class="container">
					<h2>Why bother with post processing?</h2>
					<p>Post processing is a relatively recent development where, after a frame is rendered, "after effects" that aren't present in the actual geometry of the scene are added to the final render. Examples of these effects include lens flares, depth of field, film grain and motion blur. Most of these effects are direct results of trying to simulate the artifacts and what some may consider the flaws that come from traditional filming techniques. It's completely reasonable to say that lens flares and film grain only worsen an otherwise pure digital image, and that there's no reason they have to be included. In fact, these extra steps actually require additional processing power. So why include them? They simualte what would happen if the game were actually being filmed by real cameras, and the more realistic a game looks the more we expect to see these artifacts. We've spent so much time watching movies that we expect to see motion blur on fast objects, and adding it in often makes a game feel more "realistic" by playing to our ingrained expectations.</p>

					<h1>Narrative</h1>
				</div>

			<section class="module content">
				<div class="container">
					<h2>Why is narrative crucial to a quality game?</h2>
					<p>Narratives drive quality games. Narratives provide context and motivation for player actions. Sure, some games have simple narratives, but nearly every modern game provides at least some context so that a player has a reason for doing whatever it is they do in the game. It gives them a reason beyond mechanics alone to keep playing. Maybe they support the goals of the player character or maybe the just want to see what happens next, but a narrative gives a player a keep coming back. Many games today are actually primarily driven by their narratives, and due to thier interactive nature games afford a unique realm for interactive storytelling.</p>
